This website will be a place to store some photographs I've taken in the past semester. There will be a home page, about page and three themed pages that center around the subject of the photographs (Nature, Cityscapes and portraits). Hopefully, it will convey my progress and improvements in photography as we move toward the end of the digital photogarphy class I am taking. It should be for a wide audience, anyone interested in photographic art but mostly it will be sent to family and friends. This started as a COVID hobby and has grown to something I want to pursue in the future.
